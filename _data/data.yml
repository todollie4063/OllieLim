          Completed a part-time BSc degree sponsored by Capgemini, undertaken concurrently with full-time employment. 
          The curriculum encompassed a diverse array of subjects, ranging from technical computer science modules to business-focused and consulting topics.
          Notably, my dissertation project involved the design, development, and presentation of an automation solution in Azure. 
          This solution facilitated the scanning of a platform for potential non-compliant resources, subsequently automating the ticket creation process in Azure DevOps to address these issues efficiently.
